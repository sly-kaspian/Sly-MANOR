1. "index.html": This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of the website. It will include references to the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files. It will contain various DOM elements with unique id names that can be used for styling and scripting purposes.

2. "styles.css": This is the main CSS file that will contain custom styles for the website. It will use class and id selectors that correspond to the DOM elements defined in the "index.html" file.

3. "tailwind.css": This is the CSS file for Tailwind, a utility-first CSS framework. It will be linked in the "index.html" file and will provide pre-defined styles that can be used throughout the website.

Shared Dependencies:

1. DOM Element IDs: These are unique identifiers for HTML elements that can be used in both the CSS files for styling and in JavaScript files for scripting. The exact names will depend on the structure and content of the website.

2. CSS Class Names: These are identifiers that can be used to apply styles to multiple HTML elements. They will be defined in both the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files and used in the "index.html" file.

3. CSS Selectors: These are patterns used to select the element(s) you want to style. They will be used in both the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files to apply styles to the HTML elements defined in the "index.html" file.

4. HTML Element Tags: These are used to create elements on the web page. They will be used in the "index.html" file and can be referenced in the CSS files for styling.

5. Link to CSS Files: The "index.html" file will contain links to the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files, allowing it to use the styles defined in these files.
